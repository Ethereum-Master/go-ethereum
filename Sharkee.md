CATO token started as the first CAT Meme token on Ethereum. 19417 CATO tokens were airdropped to 7000+ early supporters on twitter. CATO token market price at token launch was 0.0001$ . CATO grew overtime with the support of community.
Later on CATO made an advance Serum Based DEX on Ethereum which helped the traders to get info like holders, liquidity, mint address, token website, supply and volume data being parsed by Ethereum Beach API.
CATO made this DEX for the community as at that time people were facing problems to find new tokens on Ethereum with all the necessary info consolidated at one place.
Later on we moved towards building the first android app which will eliminate the problem of hoping into different discord servers to know more about the project and asking around the market cap of tokens as we have created the new CATO APP which compiles all the needed information of the tokens native to Ethereum.
